/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the survey application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset restricts read access to the `surveys` collection to authenticated users with a specific email.
 * All write access is denied.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /surveys/{docId}: Stores survey data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Only users with a specific email are allowed to list or get surveys.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) on surveys are denied.
