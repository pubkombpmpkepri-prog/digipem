/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the survey application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset restricts read access to the `surveys` collection to authenticated admin users.
 * Write access is denied for all users in this prototype.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The primary data is stored in the `surveys` collection at the root of the database.
 * Each document represents a single survey submission.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Only authenticated admins are allowed to read surveys.
 * - No user-generated content is allowed in this prototype.
 * - No data validation is performed in this prototyping phase beyond auth checks.
